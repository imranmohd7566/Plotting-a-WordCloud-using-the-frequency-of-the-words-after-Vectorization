# Plotting-a-WordCloud-using-the-frequency-of-the-words-after-Vectorization
# Comparing the wordclouds for two different word vectorization methods.
# In the count vectorizer wordcloud(left figure in Fig-1) we can see that the words broke, band, first, gave, husband. This words looks repetitive because this is a watches dataset and these kind of words are common. Count vectorizer gives the values as 0 or 1 and more the number of times this word comes the frequency of that word increases. 
# In the Tf Idf vectorizer wordcloud(right figure in Fig-1) we see that words like espect, excelent, perfect, ador. These words doesnâ€™t look very commonly used by people, and since the Tf-Idf vectorizer works in a way that it takes inverse frequency of words meaning that it gives more importance to the words that are less common.
