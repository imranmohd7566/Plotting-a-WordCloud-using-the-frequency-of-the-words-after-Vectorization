# Plotting-a-WordCloud-using-the-frequency-of-the-words-after-Vectorization
Comparing the wordclouds for two different word vectorization methods.

In the count vectorizer wordcloud we can see that the words ahead, alreadi, cant, box, and come. This words looks repetitive because this is a watches dataset and these kind of words are common. Count vectorizer gives the values as 0 or 1 and more the number of times this word comes the frequency of that word increases. 

In the Tf Idf vectorizer wordcloud we see that words like espect, excelent, perfect, and goog. These words doesnâ€™t look very commonly used by people, and since the Tf-Idf vectorizer works in a way that it takes inverse frequency of words meaning that it gives more importance to the words that are less common.
